Assignment-03-Q1-Hypothesis-Testing-
A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions. Cutlets.csv

Assume Null hyposthesis as Ho: μ1 = μ2 (There is no difference in diameters of cutlets between two units).

Thus Alternate hypothesis as Ha: μ1 ≠ μ2 (There is significant difference in diameters of cutlets between two units) 2 Sample 2 Tail test applicable

Assume Null Hypothesis as Ho: Independence of categorical variables (male-female buyer rations are similar across regions (does not vary and are not related) Thus Alternate Hypothesis as Ha: Dependence of categorical variables (male-female buyer rations are NOT similar across regions (does vary and somewhat/significantly related)
Inference: As (p-value = 0.6603) > (α = 0.05); Accept the Null Hypothesis i.e. Independence of categorical variables Thus, male-female buyer rations are similar across regions and are not related
